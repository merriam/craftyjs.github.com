Welcome to the Crafty tutorial section. This is very much a work in progress. You can find already written chapters to the left. Please help out by [forking](https://github.com/craftyjs/craftyjs.github.com).


The tutorials explain only one topic per chapter. Simple explanations and references to the detailed chapter will be given if other, perhaps more advanced, parts of Crafty are required in examples and text.

The bananabomber chapter was written by sorenbs a while ago. I have updated it and ported it to markdown to provide a starting point and quick syntax reference.

Please keep in mind that a lot has happened in the last year and as such code presented in old articles are of little use. If you need help and are not using the latest version pf Crafty the first thing we will help you with is to update :-)
